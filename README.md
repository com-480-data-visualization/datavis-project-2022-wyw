## Milestone 1 

### Dataset

The first dataset we choose to use is __Best Artworks of All Time__, which can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time. The dataset collects artworks of the 50 most influential painters of all time, and associated with the basic information of each artists retrieved from wikipedia. In detail, this collection contains 3 files:
* __artists.csv__: The basic information of each artists, including their names, years, gendres, nationnalities, bios, wikipedia links and paintings
* __images.zip__: The paintings of each artists. All images are full size and divided in corresponding folders and sequentially numbered
* __resized.zip__: Same work with images.zip but images have been resized and extracted from folder structure. Images in this file have smaller size which allow us to process model faster

In addition, we want to show some interesting features related with time, which are missing in the first dataset. So we use another dataset __Painter by Numbers__ as a complement, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/painter-by-numbers. This dataset collects 103250 paintings along with the artist name, creation year, genre, source, style, title and some data used for model training.

Considering the preprocessing, we pick the paintings in __Painter by Numbers__ dataset created by influential artists according to information in  __Best Artworks of All Time__ and combine the useful information in two datasets. For convenience, we focus on 30 influential artists with a large number of artworks in the dataset. The detail of preprocessing can be seen in __Exploratory Data Analysis__.
 

### Problematic

Painting is an important form of visual arts, it can be used to communicate ideas, create a sense of beauty, explore the nature of perception, or express strong emotions. By appreciating painting, we can enrich our spirituality, acquire knowledge and inspiration, discover a vivid history and so on. However, many people are laymen of art and don't know how to start the artistic journey. Our project aims to be a nice start point for people who are interested in art by providing an interactive space for people to learn and explore paintings in various styles from 30 famous artists.

The main axis we want to develop in our visualization are stated as following:
* __The transformation of artist's painting style throughout his life__

    As an artist grows and matures as a painter and as a person, the painting style of an artist may change, we want to visualize that change for each artist.
* __The development of painting style in time__ 

    With the innovation in techique and the change of perception, from emergence to maturity, a paticular painting style develops. And different painting styles emerged at different periods in time. We want to visualize how painting style developed throughout history. 
* __The special styles of artists in their paintings__

    By analyzing the colors and the geometric patterns inside the pictures, we want to indentify the artist own special style and then speculate the corresponding painter of differnet picture.
* __The connections between different artists in same genre__ 

    By exploring the common ground between differnet artists' paintings within the same genre, we want to summarize their similarity and learn more about each genre.
* __One picture in different genres__
 
    By reconstructing images in the style of another image, we want to transfer a picture to the style of any painting we like.

> - Why is your approach original?

   We provide a more comprehensive and interactive guide into the artworks of 30 influential artists. By browsing through our website, people can not only familiarize themseleves with various painters and styles through collections of artworks, but also learn visually how painting styles have evolved throughout a paticular painter's life and how artworks in general have evolved throughout history. To make it interactive, people can not only choose the painters or styles they want to inspect more closely, but also test their knowledge by guessing the painters of images and transfer their own photos to the style of their favourite artworks.
