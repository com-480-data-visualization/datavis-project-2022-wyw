## Milestone 1 

### Dataset

The dataset we choose to use is Best Artworks of All Time, which can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time. The dataset collect artworks of the 50 most influential painters of all time, and associated with basic information retrieved from wikipedia. In detail, this collection contains 3 files:
* artists.csv: Basic information of each painter, including name, years, gender, nationnality, bio, wikipedia and paintings
* images.zip: All artists' paintings (full size), divided in folders and sequentially numbered
* resized.zip: Same work with images.zip but images have been resized and extracted from folder structure



### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?

> - Why is your approach original?

   We provide a more comprehensive and interactive guide into the artworks of the 50 most influential artists of all time. By browsing through our website, people can not only familiarize themseleves with various painters and genres through collections of artworks, but also learn visually how painting styles have evolved throughout a paticular painter's life and how artworks in general have evolved throughout history. To make it interactive, people can not only choose the painters or genres they want to inspect more closely, but also test their knowledge by guessing the painters of images and transfer their own photos to the style of their favourite artworks. 

> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
